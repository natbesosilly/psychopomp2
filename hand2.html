    <div id="mercurytxt">
        <p>in the children's hospital level as well, we learn that his name is 'crusnr colven', or 'the king of mercury'. for sake of simplicity, his name is simply 'mercury' from hereon. like stated before, mercury wields a rusted nail rather than a hammer, like his female counterpart.</p>
        <p>we can infer that he is an accomplice to the celestial family and the king of all dogs, being a sort of butler to them from the start. after waking up in a motel, the arroyo inn, mercury steps out and speaks with the king of all dogs, which opens it's face to talk to him.</p>
        <p>it explains that something terrible has awakened, telling mercury to look to the bleeding earth above. here, it is confirmed that the bleeding earth and earth are two separate planets. mercury is on the earth, while venus was on the bleeding earth. the king of all dogs explains that his face has been abstracted as well.</p>

    <div id="mercurytxt">
        <p>mercury is tasked with gathering the celestial family, likely known as the 'caldmen four', being the mother, father, child, and dog, and bringing them to the meeting place. mercury has to explore the desert for them, and eventually finds the three that he needed.</p>

    <div id="mercurytxt">
        <p>after gathering the three, they are brought to the meeting place, where we can clearly see the bleeding earth. soon enough, a beam of light shoots outward from the bleeding earth. this is said to be venus's ascension, as it happens minutes after the king of all dogs says that 'something terrible has awakened.' the earth shakes, incapacitating mercury, and the screen suddenly changes to a teaser for the titlescreen of psychopomp 2.</p>
        <br>
        <p>the epilogue is done at this point, but the announcement for psychopomp two has much more lore teasers within.</p>
        <p>for example, it explains that instead of going downward into the earth for learning the secrets of it, mercury will go upward, into towering structures in the desert sky.</p>

                it is rather hard to see, but mercury has stag beetle horns in this image.

        <p>this image perhaps shows that mercury will be more in-tune than venus with his second ruling, that being of beetles. </p>
