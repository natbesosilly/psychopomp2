        <p>psychopomp GOLD, commonly known as just psychopomp, is a surreal psychological horror developed by finn tanguay/FADING CLUB/karbonic.</p>
        <p>it supposedly takes place on a planet called 'the bleeding earth', or 'the bloody earth', as seen in the epilogue at the very end of the game.</p>
        <p>this website is dedicated to the lore and meaning of psychopomp.</p>
        <br>
        <p>it starts with the story of how the 'machine that lets me read people's minds when i want to', or the 'psychopomp' for short, was made. it's a helmet that was confirmed to be made entirely out of metal. weighing thirty pounds, it had a satellite dish on the left side, and two antennas on the right. it was made because the main character thought that everyone had powers, and they've been hiding them from her her whole life.</p>

    <p>it didn't do what the main character thought it would do. instead of letting her read people's minds, it allowed her to see other worlds. these 'catacombs', were built under government-funded buildings buildings such as a waste facility or public schools. they were filled with grotesque creatures, disallowed from seeing the sun.</p>
    <p>through these catacombs she explores, leaving once she finds an 'egg of the earth' in each one.</p>
