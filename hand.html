        <p>fans have multiple named for her, such as 'venus', or 'vena', though we learn from the children's hospital level that her real name is 'c'venash vishneri,' and that she's the queen of venus. from now on, when i'm referring to the main character, her name is now 'venus'.</p>
        <p>her weapon of choice is a wooden-handled hammer, as stated before. because of this, and multiple different reasons, people believe that it is intentional that venus and the secondary character were made to be exact opposites. venus is paranoid, wields a hammer, and is associated with the female symbol. the secondary character is much more collected, wields a nail, and is mainly associated with the male symbol. hammers are mainly symbolism of destruction, while nails are symbolism of construction. even the title sprites are the opposite, with venus having red with a black outline and the secondary character having black with a red outline.</p>
        <p>this makes sense for the destruction part, as at the end of the game, venus supposedly blows a crater into the bleeding earth as she takes off after collecting every egg.</p>
        <p>on the other hand, venus is mainly associated with dragonflies. this is both strengthened by the 'home' ending, and the game over screen, where it depicts a dragonfly held down by pins.</p>

        <p>from this same paper in the children's hospital level, it says that "[c'venash vishneri and crusnr colven's] names seemingly refer to two fictitious planets, venus and mercury respectively, which they held dominion over." it also explains that the two likely played the roles of figures of worship, as seen through different and transient locations. in the sewage facility, there is a church with a statue depicting venus, as well as something similar in the 'nursey hollow' ephemeral location. in front of the second one, a thrait is asking where her queen has gone, likely denoting that the thraits worshipped venus.</p>
        <p>through transient, ephemeral, and abberant locations, we learn a little more about venus and the world of psychopomp. it tells the history of the world in one of them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in the natural history museum ephemeral location, it starts with humans, explained as hairy bipeds, expressive and social creatures. it was said that the last human died in captivity years ago. it then moves onto thraits, a tribe of seemingly only women. they look like bipedal alligators with a little bit of fur. they were described by doing nothing of note. it was said that the last thrait died in captivity, "and we are better for it." it then moves onto humans again, though these humans are different. they're made of clay and dust. </li>
            <li>this is reinforced in another location, the thrait village, one of them explains seeing a human get hit by a car. "nothing but clay and dust," she said.</li>
            <li>in the human seedbed ephemeral location, every single one you talk to can'f form a full sentence. when you exit the level, a twitching, clay-like depiction of venus is waiting by the exit. i interpret this as the universe trying to recreate venus as a whole. she's not like these humans, as in her injured sprites, she is seen to have blood, and these "humans" do not.</li>

        <p>venus had awoken from her chrysalis, shed her 'royal dermis', as put in the mariana trench level, and ascended to godhood. when this happens, she molds the 'lifemeat of the world', and flies upward after thanking the helmet for it's contributions, likely blowing half of the bleeding earth to hell. the words "CONNECTION TO SUBJECT LOST" appear. shortly after, "TRACKING ALTERNATIVE SUBJECT" "ALTERNATIVE SUBJECT FOUND" "TIME TO WAKE UP." appear. from here, the epilogue starts with the secondary character.</p>
