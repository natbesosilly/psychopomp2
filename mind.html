        <p>the celestial family, or the caldmen four, consist of the child, the mother, the father, and the king of all dogs, all of which don't have official names. except the king of all dogs.</p>
        <p>they are supposedly gods far more powerful than mercury and venus, with the dog being the most powerful. the caldmen four, <em>the stars,</em> are classified as 'celestial objects moving at unheard of speed through space, leaving a trail darkness behind them.'</p>

        <p>they all came into existence at the exact same moment, as well as every single one of them is simply "taking on a form that they prefer," according to karbonic.</p>
<h2>the mother</h2>
<p>the mother speaks of snakes when you first meet her. under her cloak, mercury can hear the sound of snake-like skin sliding against itself. she wears a black cloak, and her eyes are shadowed over, as with all the other family members. as well as this, she has brown hair that seemed to curl upward near her left cheek.</p>

        <h2>the father</h2>
        <p>the father speaks of flowers when you meet him, as well as the poisons that they emit. mercury notes that he seemed smug, with short brown hair and shadowed-over eyes. he wears an orange outfit, with a white undershirt.</p>

        <h2>the child</h2>
        <p>the child speaks of puppets. mercury notes that there was more folds under her eyes than there should be, leading to the belief that she's much older than she claims she is. she wears a pink outfit, complete with a pink hat and black bow to go on top.</p>

        <h2>the king of all dogs</h2>
        <p>the dog is the one you meet with the most. venus is the first one to see it, noting that it "might be feral." it is a white dog, that occasionally splits it's face open in a certain interaction, that being the sicth time you talk to it the first time you see it as venus.</p>
